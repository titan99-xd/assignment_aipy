Assignment 4
Exercise 1: Regression to the mean
1. When throwing two fair dice the probabilites of possible values are
2 or 12 1/36 = 2.8%
3 or 11 2/36 = 5.6%
4 or 10 3/36 = 8.3%
5 or 9 4/36 = 11.1%
6 or 8 5/36 = 13.9%
7 6/36 = 16.7%
The histogram looks like this.
0) Write a for loop which repeats the steps 1)-3) below for values of n ranging as
500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 50000, 100000
1) Use numpy to simulate throwing of two dice n times. Compute the sum of the dice.
2) Use numpyâ€™s histogram() function to compute the frequencies as
h,h2 = np.histogram(s,range(2,14))
where s contains the sum.
3) Use matplotlib's bar function to plot the histogram as
plt.bar(h2[:-1],h/n)
and show the value of n in the title.
4) What do you observe? You may need to run the loop a few times to see it.
5) How is this related to "regression to the mean"?




Exercise 2: Regression Model
Consider the data from the file weight-height.csv.
1) Inspect the dependence between height and weight using a scatter plot. You may use either of
the variables as independent variable.
2) Choose appropriate model for the dependence
3) Perform regression on the data using your model of choice
4) Plot the results
5) Compute RMSE and R2 value
6) Assess the quality of the regression (visually and using numbers) in your own words.
You are not required to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Of course you are
completely free to experiment it here already.
It is recommended that you use the module sklearn for all your computations.
